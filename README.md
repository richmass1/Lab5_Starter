1. Unit testing probably wouldn't work for a messaging feature, as messaging relies on more than just one chunk of code. For the messaging feature to be validated as working, the sending client, the receiving client, and the server that conveys the message all have to be working together. Checking just one of those things wouldn't ensure that the messaging feature actually works.
2. Unit testing could work for this, since it only relies on the client software on the sending side.
